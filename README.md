Our solution comprises of Four important components

Component 1: Device like Raspberry Pi will be connected to cloud. The speech to text converter with file name "speech-to-text" shows the simulated way of doing it using IBM speech to  text converter.

Component 2: A CCTV records the surrounding location and raise an alarm in case of crowd gathering or not following the social distancing norms using deep learning algorithm

Component 3:IoT component to connect real time data with cloud. "iot-dashboard" file shows simulated flow of using it uisng Watson and sample input flow is given in the dashboard

Component 4: Web application and mobile app with dashboard service. "web-app-dashboard" file has the sample dashboard view

Do watch our video "Hackathon" to understand our idea and concepts

Note: Due to security reasons we could not share our full working code and we have tried
our level best to give tough of how each component looks like and the final dashboard
